### Project 1: GitHub Issue Triage Agent
An autonomous agent that monitors a designated repository for new issues. It uses an LLM to accurately **classify** the issue's intent (question, ug, or eature) and then executes the appropriate action: providing a context-aware answer or applying a triage label.
